tank go brrrr

I was bored in high school computer labs so I made a node.js multiplayer tank game

Enjoyability of the player is questionable, HOWEVER I sure did enjoy implementing client-server communication and making a system for creating fully customizable
game objects and rendering them. (Vehicles and maps are generated just by a bunch of JSON numbers - no textures)
